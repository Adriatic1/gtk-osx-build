The files here are used together with the build script "jhbuild" to
build GTK+ for Mac OS X.

You need Mac OS X 10.4 or newer and Xcode 2.5 or newer. Make sure you
have subversion (svn) installed, 10.5 has it by default.

Then run the script provided here:

 ./gtk-osx-build-setup.sh

After that has completed, do the following:

 jhbuild bootstrap
 jhbuild build

information.
