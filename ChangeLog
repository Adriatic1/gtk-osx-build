	* gtk-osx.modules: Add gail. Also add some additional really
	unsupported modules just to make it easier to build some test
	apps.
	- Upgrade the docbook setup.
	
2007-08-23  Richard Hult  <richard@imendio.com>

	* gtk-osx.modules: Add doxygen, libsigc++2, glibmm, cairomm,
	gtkmm, poppler. Note that those don't build out of the box, some
	manual tweaking is needed. Also add dbus and dbus-glib, untested.

	* jhbuildrc-gtk-osx: Small updates.

2007-07-14  Richard Hult  <richard@imendio.com>

	* gtk-osx-build: Update cairo tarball to 1.4.10.

	* gtk-osx.modules: Move cairo to the 1.4.10 tarball since we don't
	really want to depend on 1.5+pixman yet.

2007-05-28  Richard Hult  <richard@imendio.com>

	* gtk-osx-build: Fix hard coded prefix.

	* jhbuildrc-gtk-osx: Attempt to add perl path setup.

2007-05-28  Richard Hult  <richard@imendio.com>

	* gtk-osx.modules: Remove the extra modules, since they don't
	build without a lot of manual work anyway.

2007-05-17  Richard Hult  <richard@imendio.com>

	* Add jhbuild stuff.

2007-04-26  Richard Hult  <richard@imendio.com>

	* gtk-osx-build: Add some more modules to "extra".

2007-04-24  Richard Hult  <richard@imendio.com>

	* gtk-osx-build: Put all the gnu software in a mirror at
	people.imendio.com, should help downloading the bootstrap
	packages, since the gnu server seems very slow or down even
	sometimes.

2007-04-20  Richard Hult  <richard@imendio.com>

	* gtk-osx-build: Improve comments and add note about cloning cairo
	taking a while.

2007-04-02  Richard Hult  <richard@imendio.com>

	* Correct the commit from below to get the path right, thanks to
	"plops" on the forum.

2007-02-17  Richard Hult  <richard@imendio.com>

	* Get the right PERL5LIB for older versions (e.g. panther),
	fix from Mathias Hasselmann.

2007-01-11  Richard Hult  <richard@imendio.com>

	* gtk-osx-build: Correct the PERL5LIB variable.

2007-01-11  Richard Hult  <richard@imendio.com>

	* gtk-osx-build: Support install-check $HOME/bin as well.

2007-01-08  Richard Hult  <richard@imendio.com>
